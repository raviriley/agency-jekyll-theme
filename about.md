### Adam Hiller
During his career, Adam has represented clients in a multitude of roles in bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings: Chapter 11 debtors, Chapter 7 corporate debtors, creditors’ committees, secured creditors, Chapter 7 trustees, landlords, asset purchasers, executory contract parties, taxing authorities, and post-confirmation trusts. He has also represented numerous clients in preference actions, other bankruptcy litigation, non-bankruptcy fraudulent conveyance actions, and collection and enforcement of judgments under Maryland law. He is admitted to practice in Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia (inactive), as well as the federal district courts in Delaware and Maryland, and the United States Courts of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Fourth Circuit.

Adam began his legal career as a law clerk to the Honorable E. Stephen Derby, a judge (now retired) for the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland. Following his clerkship, he joined the firm of Tydings & Rosenberg LLP in Baltimore, Maryland, where he practiced primarily Chapter 11 bankruptcy law and non-bankruptcy collections. He then moved to Delaware and became an associate in the Bankruptcy and Restructuring Group of Pepper Hamilton LLP for approximately seven years. Thereafter, he opened the Wilmington, Delaware office of Draper & Goldberg, PLLC (which later became Atlantic Law Group, LLC), where he continued his commercial bankruptcy practice while assisting with the firm’s foreclosure and consumer bankruptcy practice. He joined Pinckney, Harris & Weidinger, LLC as a member in 2009, until opening Hiller Law in 2011 (under its prior name).

Mr. Hiller earned a B.A. with honors from Claremont McKenna College in 1993, as a dual major in psychology and legal studies. He graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law and earned his J.D. in 1997.

Mr. Hiller has been a member of numerous legal organizations, including the American Bankruptcy Institute, the Bankruptcy Bar Association of Maryland, the Delaware Bankruptcy Inn of Court, the American Bar Association’s Business Law Section (Bankruptcy Committee), and the Arts Committee of the Delaware State Bar Association. He participated in a subcommittee of the Delaware Local Rules Committee in drafting certain amendments to the Delaware local rules.

Mr. Hiller has a very strong commitment to fulfill his ethical obligations for pro bono service to the community. Since entering private practice nearly 20 years ago, he has represented at least one client almost every year referred by Maryland Volunteer Lawyers Services or Delaware Volunteer Lawyers Services in a case without receiving a fee. Moreover, for many years he served as general counsel (on a pro bono basis) to a non-profit organization called the Maryland Society for Sight, which provides vision-screening and eyeglasses to the indigent, as well as sight-related services to the blind and visually impaired.

Mr. Hiller serves as mentors for less senior lawyers, law students, and law clerks in the community. The firm also regularly accepts appointments from referral agencies to provide pro bono assistance to those that may be unable to afford to pay an attorney.

Adam is actively involved in Profundo Bono, a not-for-profit community theater group comprised of judges, lawyers, and legal professionals. All of the net proceeds generated by Profundo Bono are donated directly to the Combined Campaign for Justice.

In his spare time, Adam enjoys spending time with his family, cooking, choir singing, reading science fiction, consuming spicy foods, playing the guitar, visiting the zoo, catching up on the comics, and listening to audio books. (Ask him about his prior career as a puppeteer.)
