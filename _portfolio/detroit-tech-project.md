DCTP Mission: "We use and create technology rooted in community needs that strengthens neighbors’ connection to each other, and to the planet. We design, build and facilitate a healthy integration of technology into people’s lives and communities, allowing them the fundamental human right to communicate."

The DCTP project team will be working with a professional developer and designer to create and integrate the design and frontend of the learning platform, in order to share the community tech/internet networking curriculum that will be used for education and advocacy.
