T4SG was founded in the winter semester of 2020, right before when in-person connections have been disrupted and events were virtual. However, we have hosted informal hangouts for members and organized community care events, making sure that every member feels a part of a larger community of students.

<h4>The past events and activities include:</h4>

- **Kumospace hangout**
- **Halloween and Valentine's day hangout**
- **Communal Grief event**: Processing through contemporary grief while learning the meaning of remembrance and togetherness. We created a communal hope jamboard to remind ourselves of the hopes.

**Through hosting events and activities on various platforms, we aim to engage members in the way that suits them the best and normalize "[community care](https://mashable.com/article/community-care-versus-self-care)" as one of the central values moving forward.**
 
**Join our community and let us know a social event you'd like to see in the future.**
