In 2020-2021, we have one project team working on a website + volunteer dashboard for the Lunar Doula Collective (LDC).
&nbsp;
This project would allow our partner to organize their volunteers, volunteering event scheduling, and communication between the coordinator and volunteers more efficiently. The purpose is to improve the previous manual process of signing up volunteers to event and emailing them for reminders. It also serves as a home base for visitors to learn more about Lunar Doula Collective and
have the option to contribute.

This project will continue as one of next year's project teams to add in new features and designs.
