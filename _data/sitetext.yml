    text: "The New World, same as the Old World"
    body: "Approximately 500 years ago, civilization met a violent end. And the world went on. Amidst cratered mountains and magnetic anomalies, organic life survived and flourished. As biodiversity exploded, new forms of life joined the amnesiac survivors and the land of Tsamsara was born. Magic now permeates the new world, tentatively co-existing with reclaimed, old world technology. Outside the walls of growing metropolises, adventure awaits."
